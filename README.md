Before you start you need a codesandbox account, after that you will be able to fork this project (top right corner).

Please read the task description below and when completed, share the link to the forked version by sending it to maciej@tagvenue.com along any comments you wish to share! Please make sure the sandbox settings are set to public, so it can be access with the url you shared!

## Task 

You received a fragment of the old code from a legacy part of our fictitious internal system. 
Code is responsible for getting a valid HTTPS url from the user and sending it our (simulated) API.

Your task is to refactor the code, fix any existing bugs and improve overall UX.

Do not add any external dependencies, the default browser UI is fine.

Feel free to add/remove files as well as leave comments in the code.

Let's make the best of it within 30min, it's just an internal component anyway.
